# Ringbahn Rent

Valid for November 2024 through April 2025.

## Total monthly rent

- Net cold rent: 1.159,95€
- Operating costs: 145,00€
- Heating: 200,00€
- Internet: 37,98€
- Electricity: 63,00€
- Broadcasting contribution (Rundfunkbeitrag): 18,36€
------
**Total: 1.624,29€**

The net cold rent increases every November as defined in the rental contract with VDLB.
Vattenfall adjusted electricity in May 2025 to reflect higher usage and new pricing.

## Per-person rent calculation

We are 3 people. Because Tushar’s and Yannik’s rooms are slightly larger than Aziz’s, the net cold rent is split by weight:

- Tushar: 35%
- Yannik: 35%
- Aziz: 30%

Operating costs, heating, internet, electricity, and broadcasting contribution are split equally. These shared costs total 145,00€ + 200,00€ + 37,98€ + 63,00€ + 18,36€ = 464,34€ per month.

This results in the following per-person rent:

- **Aziz**: 1.159,95€ × 0,30 + 464,34€ ÷ 3 = **502,77€**
- **Tushar/Yannik**: 1.159,95€ × 0,35 + 464,34€ ÷ 3 = **560,76€**

## Auxiliary cost statement (Nebenkostenabrechnung)

An annual auxiliary cost statement (ACS) from the landlord covers operating costs (building maintenance, cleaning, etc.), heating, cold water, hot water and cable TV. It does not include electricity or internet, which are under our own contracts.

### ACS 2024

- Document: [Nebenkostenabrechnung 2024 (PDF)](/ringbahn-rent/Nebenkostenabrechnung%202024.pdf)
- Requested back pay for 2024: **1.552,89€**

#### Operating costs

- Monthly increase vs. previous advance payments: 41,00€ (per ACS 2024)
- Implications:
  - Back pay attributable to this increase for 2024: **490,92€** total → 490,92€ ÷ 3 = **163,64€ per person** (due once, after ACS 2024 is confirmed; expected November 2025).
  - From November 2025 onward: +41,00€ per month total → 41,00€ ÷ 3 = **13,67€ per person monthly**.

#### Net cold rent

- Annual increase per rental contract (VDLB): +23,20€ per month (this year)
- From November 2025 onward: 23,20€ ÷ 3 = **7,73€ per person monthly**.

#### Cable TV

- We do not make advance payments for cable TV; the landlord provides the option and charges for it.
- 2024 amount: **48,68€** total → 48,68€ ÷ 3 = **16,23€ per person** (one-time, after ACS 2024 is confirmed; expected November 2025).
- Legal note: Since July 2024, landlords can no longer pass on cable TV costs to tenants who do not want or use cable TV. For ACS 2025, review the cable TV position (Kabelfernsehgebühr) carefully. See: [Mieterbund overview on §2 Nr. 15 BetrKV / TKModG](https://mieterbund.de/app/uploads/2025/02/6-Stefan-Bentrop-Die-Neuregelung-%C2%A7-2-Nr.-15-BetrKV-durch-das-TKModG.pdf).

#### Heating, hot water, and auxiliary house costs

The second page of ACS 2024 bundles heating, hot water, and auxiliary house costs (cold and waste water). It demands a back pay of **1.013,29€** for 2024 and proposes raising monthly advances by **85,00€** to avoid a large back pay in 2026.

- Heating
  - Usage 2024: **13.484 kWh**, also seems average, see reference usage on page 7 of ACS 2024 and https://utopia.de/ratgeber/durchschnittliche-heizkosten-pro-qm-in-deutschland-wann-zahlst-du-zu-viel_736030/.
  - Cost 2024: **2.252,43€**
  - Rate 2024: **0,167€ per kWh**, which is average, see e.g. https://www.verbraucherzentrale.de/wissen/energie/heizen-und-warmwasser/fernwaerme-kosten-sparen-und-gleichzeitig-das-klima-schonen-34038.
  - Comment: Although this is roughly 40% higher than 2023, it is still within a reasonable range. The reference usage is only about 8% lower (see ACS 2024, p. 7).

- Hot water (Warmwasser)
  - Volume 2024: **49,72 m³** → about 45 liters per person per day.
  - Warmwasserspiegel classification: Class D. To reach Class C, reduce to ~43 l/person/day (≈4,5% less). Try the [Warmwasserspiegel calculator](https://www.warmwasserspiegel.de/verbrauch-verstehen/).
  - Indicative energy need (10→60°C, central heating): approximately **5.886,23 kWh** is plausible for this volume; see [heizung.de explanation](https://www.heizung.de/ratgeber/diverses/berechnung-der-warmwasserkosten-so-geht-s.html).
  - Cost 2024: **434,07€**, in line with typcial costs, see https://www.t-online.de/heim-garten/energie/id_100185968/warmwasserkosten-so-viel-zahlt-der-durchschnitt-zahlen-sie-zu-viel-.html.

- Auxiliary house costs (Hausnebenkosten)
  - Total 2024: **726,79€** (cold water, waste water, device-related costs)

  - Cold water
    - Total water (cold + hot): 102,03 + 49,72 = **151,75 m³**.
    - Per person per day: 151,75 m³ ÷ 3 ÷ 365 ≈ **138,6 l/person/day**.
    - Rate used: **1,92€ per m³**, about 6% above a Berlin average of 1,81€; see e.g. [Wohnglück guide](https://wohnglueck.de/artikel/wasserkosten-berechnen-82183) and [BDEW average](https://www.bdew.de/presse/presseinformationen/zahl-der-woche-121-liter-leitungswasser/).

  - Waste water
    - Based on cold water consumption. As reference, BWB charged **2,16€ per m³** in 2024; see [BWB fee sheet 2024 (PDF)](https://www.bwb.de/de/assets/downloads/2024_gebuehrenblatt.pdf).
    - ACS 2024 uses **2,22€ per m³**, about 3% above 2,16€ → plausible.

  - Additional device costs
    - Fixed position; **92,13€** in 2024; not influenceable by tenants.

## Things that need clarification

- The ecotrend ista website shows heating and warm water usage, starting from May 2024. For completeness, I fill in the missing months from January to April with values from 2025. While yearly heating usage seems comparable to ACS 2024, the warm water kWh seem off. The sum of Ista portal values is about 2700 kWh but our ACS 2024 shows 5886,23 kWh. How can this be explained?

- Although m^3 usage of warm water is the same as in 2022, the kWh usage exploded. Starting from 457,07 kWh in 2022, with 1316,15 kwH in 2023 up to 5886,23 kwH in 2024. How can this be explained?

## Pending actions for me

- Compare ACS 2024 with ACS 2023 and ACS 2022
- Add details on Vattenfall’s 2025 electricity price changes
